\brief

           This file contains the declaration of the `AppWindow` class,
           which is responsible for managing the main application window,
           including window creation, rendering, and cleanup.

           The `AppWindow` class utilizes GLFW for creating the window
           and OpenGL for rendering, along with ImGui for rendering the
           graphical user interface. The class provides methods for
           initializing the window, handling the drawing loop, and cleaning up
           resources when the window is closed.
